== Introduction

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm often characterised by three concepts:

Encapsulation::
	Restricting direct access to some of the object's components <<encap>>
Inheritance::
	Basing a class upon another class, retaining similar implementation. <<inherit>>
Composition::
	Combining simple classes to make more complex classes. <<comp>>
