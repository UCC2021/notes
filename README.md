Rules:

1. Do not plagiarise a lecturer's notes. Use them as guidance for creating notes, as well as the lectures themselves. Extracts are fine under fair-use, but do not simply copy and paste published lecture material. Unless explicitly specified by a lecturer, they reserve the copyright to their materials.
2. Definitions are exempt from the above rule â€“ the definition of a term, methodology, etc. must be exact for accuracy. If you can find a more appropriate or exact definition outside of the materials a lecturer has provided, please use that and provide a source.
